# Flight Planning System

Group project based on building a Java-based application that emulates flight routing. Through a command-line interface (CLI), users can create, edit, modify, and display data related to airports, airplanes, and flight paths. The core of the application features a route-finding algorithm based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, modified to account for airplane refueling capabilities when calculating optimal routes between a starting and destination airport.
